Twitter Autoload
================
A Firefox extension that automatically updates the feed on Twitter.com with new tweets.
New tweets are loaded only when the page is scrolled all the way to the top
(emulating the behavior of the Twitter and TweetDeck apps).

Built with [Jetpack](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Jetpack).
